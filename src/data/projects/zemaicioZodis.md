It’s a fully functional android application: you can subscribe for daily notification with a random word, translate Samogitian words to Lithuanian (and vice versa) and have fun with random word generator. This android app was created by using React Native. I used functional components (with hooks), for state management I used React Redux. Application stylized with CSS that is adapted to React Native. Database is installed with an app, so this app can be used offline. Žemaičio žodis is published on Google Play store.
